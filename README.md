Two projects

# Milestone 1:

Earthquakes are seismological events that cause the ground to start shaking. Depending on the intensity of the ground motion, imposed loads on a given structure can be larger or smaller and it is the responsibility of engineers to ensure the said structure achieves adequate and desired performance given the seismological setting. The intensity at which a ground motion will induce collapse of a structure is called collapse capacity of a ground motion. There are formal ways how this value can be computed that are numerically very expensive, i.e. it takes a long time even if performed on a cluster. From a practical viewpoint, it would be beneficial to develop a machine learning or statistical model to efficiently estimate the collapse capacity without having to perform expensive numerical computations on the cluster. Thanks to a large pre-computed dataset, the problem can now be addressed by the field of supervised learning methods.

The goal of this challenge is to create a regression model from scratch. This includes data loading, pre-processing, defining model architecture, training and validating, predicting the test targets and submitting here.



# Milestone 2:

The ABCD (AIST Building Change Detection) dataset is a new labeled dataset, specially geared toward constructing and evaluating damage detection systems to identify whether buildings have been washed-away by tsunami.

The goal of this challenge is to create a classification model. The task is to investigate and propose a model to outperform the baseline and the other participants.
